            <p>
              In Brazil, of all the trash produced, 30% has the potential to be
              repurposed, but only 3% actually is. The improper disposal of this
              waste ends up in rivers and, consequently, the ocean, as well as
              improvised landfills that impact public health.
            </p>

          <div class="card two">
            <p class="card__title">OUR SOLUTION</p>
            <p>
              ReClapp is a recycling app that reduces improper disposal and
              promotes the reuse and repurposing of waste in a fun way.
            </p>
            <p>
              ReClapp helps you recycle your trash, learn about how to reuse
              materials, and share your DIYs to inspire others. All while
              earning points through challenges in the quest to become a
              sustainability master.

            <p class="card__title">FEATURES üëè</p>
            <p>
              People can share their knowledge with tips on how to properly
              dispose trash, they can share a diy to repurpose a material, and
              create eco challenges for others to try out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doing eco challenges and sharing these tips gives you ecopoints
              which count towards your city, country, and global rank. You can
              share with friends and create an eco-mpetition.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the search feature, you can look up a certain type of waste
              and see all the tips and announcements people have made about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's also possible to post ‚Äùannouncements‚Äù if you accept waste to
              repurpose or reuse, like using cooked oil for soap making.

            <p>
              We think ReClapp is a good place to advertise eco-friendly
              products as we want to expand the app to other countries and
              regions as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              We would also like to form partnerships with several
              municipalities so that they can include information on how waste
              disposal is done in each city, if there are recycling programs or
              incentives.
